Application Overview
The app.py script creates a small web application using the Flask framework. Its primary purpose is to offer a health check endpoint and expose application metrics in a format consumable by Prometheus, a popular monitoring system.

The application defines two main routes:

/health (GET): This is a health check endpoint. When accessed, it simply returns a JSON response indicating {"status": "ok"}. This endpoint is crucial for container orchestration platforms (like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) to determine if the application is running and responsive.
/metrics (GET): This endpoint serves Prometheus-formatted metrics. It uses the prometheus_client library to expose internal application metrics, allowing Prometheus to scrape and store them for analysis and alerting.
The application is configured to listen on all public IP addresses (0.0.0.0) on port 5000, making it accessible within a containerized environment.

Counter Metric Creation and Usage
A key aspect of this application is its integration with Prometheus for exposing custom metrics. The application specifically leverages a Counter metric.

A Counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart. It's ideal for counting events.

In this application, a Counter named HEALTH_CHECK_CALLS is defined:

Python

HEALTH_CHECK_CALLS = Counter(
    'health_check_calls_total',
    'Total number of times the health check endpoint has been called.'
)
health_check_calls_total: This is the name of the metric that Prometheus will scrape. It follows Prometheus's naming conventions (lowercase, underscores, often ending with _total for counters).
Total number of times the health check endpoint has been called.: This is a descriptive help string that provides context for the metric in Prometheus.
Focus on the /health Endpoint and the Counter
The /health endpoint plays a direct role in incrementing this Counter:

Python

@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    start_time = time.time()
    HEALTH_CHECK_CALLS.inc() # Increment the counter
    response = jsonify({"status": "ok"})
    REQUEST_LATENCY.labels('/health').observe(time.time() - start_time) # Observe latency
    return response
Every time a GET request is made to the /health endpoint, the HEALTH_CHECK_CALLS.inc() method is called. This atomic operation increments the internal value of the health_check_calls_total counter by one.

When Prometheus scrapes the /metrics endpoint, it will collect the current value of health_check_calls_total. Over time, by observing the increase in this counter, one can track how frequently the health check endpoint is being accessed. This can be useful for:

Monitoring health check frequency: Understanding how often external systems are probing the application's health.
Identifying unexpected health check patterns: Sudden drops or spikes in health check calls might indicate issues with the orchestrator or the application itself.
Capacity planning: Although indirectly, knowing health check call volume can contribute to understanding the overall load on the application.
In summary, the health_check_calls_total counter provides a simple yet effective way to gain visibility into the usage patterns of the /health endpoint, contributing to better operational monitoring of the application.
