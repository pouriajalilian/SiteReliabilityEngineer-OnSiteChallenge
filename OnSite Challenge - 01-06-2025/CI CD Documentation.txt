This pipeline automates the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process for your Flask application. It's configured with three main stages:

Build: Constructs the Docker image for your Flask application.
Push: Authenticates with Docker Hub and pushes the newly built Docker image.
Deploy: Deploys the Flask application to a Kubernetes cluster using kubectl, creating a Docker registry secret for image pulling.


This pipeline is triggered on pushes to the main branch, ensuring that changes merged into the main codebase are automatically built, published, and deployed.

Pipeline Stages and Jobs:

The pipeline is composed of the following sequential stages, with each stage containing one or more jobs:

1. build Stage
Job: build_image
Purpose: This job is responsible for building the Docker image of your Flask application.
Environment: It utilizes the docker:dind (Docker in Docker) image, providing a self-contained Docker environment for building.
Process:
It waits for the Docker daemon to be ready using until docker info; do sleep 1; done.
It then executes docker build -t $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/$DOCKER_HUB_IMAGE_NAME:latest ./flask-app, tagging the image with your specified Docker Hub username and image name.
Trigger: This job runs only when changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. push Stage
Job: push_image
Purpose: This job pushes the newly built Docker image to Docker Hub.
Environment: Similar to the build stage, it uses the docker:dind image.
Process:
It logs into Docker Hub using the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME and a masked GitLab CI/CD variable DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD. (Important: Ensure DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD is securely configured as a masked CI/CD variable in your GitLab project settings.)
After successful login, it pushes the tagged Docker image to your Docker Hub repository.
Dependencies: This job is configured to run only after the build_image job has successfully completed.
Trigger: This job runs only when changes are pushed to the main branch.


3. deploy Stage
Job: deploy
Purpose: This final stage deploys the Flask application to your Kubernetes cluster.
Environment: It uses the alpine/kubectl:latest image, which provides the kubectl command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.
Process:
Kubeconfig Setup: It ensures that the KUBECONFIG environment variable is properly set from a GitLab CI/CD file variable. (Important: Your Kubernetes cluster configuration should be securely provided to the pipeline, typically as a secret file variable.)
Docker Registry Secret: It dynamically creates a Kubernetes secret named dockerhub-secret of type docker-registry. This secret allows your Kubernetes cluster to pull images from Docker Hub using your Docker Hub credentials.
Application Deployment: It then applies the Kubernetes Pod manifest for your Flask application. The manifest content is embedded directly within the pipeline definition using a heredoc (cat <<EOF ... EOF). (Note: Replace (*FLASK_APP_POD_MANIFEST) with your actual Kubernetes Pod manifest content.)
Dependencies: This job runs only after the push_image job has successfully completed.
Failure Handling: allow_failure: false ensures that the entire pipeline will fail if the deployment step encounters an error, providing clear feedback on deployment issues.
Trigger: This job runs only when changes are pushed to the main branch.
Variables
The pipeline utilizes the following variables, which should be configured in your GitLab project's CI/CD settings (e.g., as project variables or file variables for sensitive information):

DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKER_HUB_IMAGE_NAME: The desired name for your Docker image (e.g., flask-health-app).
DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD: (Masked CI/CD Variable) Your Docker Hub password. This must be set as a masked secret variable.
KUBECONFIG: (File CI/CD Variable) Your Kubernetes cluster configuration. This should be set as a file variable.
KUBE_NAMESPACE: The Kubernetes namespace where the application will be deployed.
This comprehensive pipeline provides a robust and automated workflow for managing your Flask application from code commit to deployment in Kubernetes using GitLab CI/CD.






 
############################### Deploy Stage Documentation (in detail):

The deploy stage is the final step in your CI/CD pipeline, responsible for taking the Docker image pushed in the previous stage and deploying it as a running application within your Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that your application is available and accessible after a successful build and push.

Job: deploy
This stage consists of a single job named deploy.

Purpose: To deploy the Flask application to a Kubernetes cluster. This involves configuring Kubernetes to access your Docker Hub image and then applying the necessary Kubernetes manifest to create or update your application's Pod.
Dependencies: This job is configured with needs: ["push_image"], meaning it will only execute after the push_image job (from the push stage) has successfully completed. This ensures that the Docker image is available on Docker Hub before attempting to deploy it.
Trigger: The job is set to run only: - main, meaning it will only be triggered when changes are pushed to the main branch.
Failure Handling: allow_failure: false is configured for this job. This is a critical setting that ensures if any step within the deploy job fails (e.g., kubectl command errors, network issues, manifest errors), the entire GitLab CI/CD pipeline will be marked as "failed". This provides immediate feedback on deployment issues, preventing silently broken deployments.

Configuration Details:

1. image: alpine/kubectl:latest

Description: This line specifies the Docker image that the deploy job will run within. alpine/kubectl:latest is a lightweight Docker image that comes pre-installed with kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. This ensures that the necessary tools are available for deployment operations.

2. before_script Section
This section defines commands that are executed before the main script of the job. They are typically used for setup and configuration.

export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG

Purpose: This command sets the KUBECONFIG environment variable within the job's execution environment.
Explanation: KUBECONFIG is a crucial environment variable that tells kubectl where to find the Kubernetes cluster configuration file. In a GitLab CI/CD context, $KUBECONFIG should be configured as a GitLab CI/CD File Variable in your project settings. GitLab securely injects the content of this file variable into the job's environment, and this export command makes it accessible to kubectl.
Security Note: The KUBECONFIG variable contains sensitive information for accessing your Kubernetes cluster and must be stored as a secure File Variable in GitLab.
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret ... | kubectl apply -f -

Purpose: This command creates (or updates if it already exists) a Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry. This secret holds the credentials necessary for your Kubernetes cluster to pull Docker images from Docker Hub.
Explanation:
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret: Initiates the creation of a secret named dockerhub-secret.
--docker-server=docker.io: Specifies that the Docker registry is Docker Hub.
--docker-username=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: Uses the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME GitLab CI/CD variable for the Docker Hub username.
--docker-password=$DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD: Uses the DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD GitLab CI/CD variable for the Docker Hub password. This variable must be configured as a masked variable in GitLab for security.
--docker-email=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME@example.com: Provides an email address. While not strictly used for authentication, it's often required for docker-registry secrets. Using a dummy email derived from the username is common here.
-n $KUBE_NAMESPACE: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace where this secret will be created. $KUBE_NAMESPACE should be defined as a GitLab CI/CD variable.
--dry-run=client -o yaml: This is a powerful combination. --dry-run=client means kubectl will not actually create the secret on the cluster immediately; instead, it will just show what it would create. -o yaml outputs this "what it would create" in YAML format.
| kubectl apply -f -: The | (pipe) sends the YAML output from the previous kubectl create secret command as input to kubectl apply -f -. kubectl apply -f - reads the YAML manifest from standard input and applies it to the Kubernetes cluster. This approach ensures that the secret is created idempotently (it won't error if it already exists and will update if necessary).
Significance: This secret is crucial because your Kubernetes Pods need to authenticate with Docker Hub to pull the flask-health-app image you've pushed. Pods can reference this secret in their imagePullSecrets to gain access.

3. script Section:

This section defines the main commands that execute the deployment logic.

echo "Deploying Flask App Pod to Kubernetes..."

Purpose: Provides a clear log message indicating the start of the deployment process.

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - -n $KUBE_NAMESPACE

(*FLASK_APP_POD_MANIFEST)
EOF

Purpose: This is a heredoc (here document) which allows you to embed a multi-line string directly within your GitLab CI/CD configuration. In this case, it contains your Kubernetes Pod manifest.

Explanation:

cat <<EOF: Starts the heredoc, reading all lines until EOF is encountered on a new line.
(*FLASK_APP_POD_MANIFEST): IMPORTANT: This is a placeholder. You must replace (*FLASK_APP_POD_MANIFEST) with the actual YAML content of your Kubernetes Pod definition. This manifest describes how your Flask application's Pod should be created (e.g., image to use, ports, environment variables, resource limits, and importantly, how to reference the dockerhub-secret for image pulling).
| kubectl apply -f - -n $KUBE_NAMESPACE: Similar to the secret creation, the cat command pipes the entire embedded Pod manifest YAML as input to kubectl apply -f -, which then applies it to your Kubernetes cluster in the specified $KUBE_NAMESPACE. kubectl apply is preferred for deployments as it is declarative and handles updates to existing resources gracefully.
echo "Flask App Pod deployment initiated."

Purpose: Provides a confirmation message that the deployment command has been executed. Note that this only indicates the command was sent, not necessarily that the Pod is fully running and healthy (that would require further kubectl commands like kubectl rollout status).
By successfully completing these steps, the deploy stage ensures that your Dockerized Flask application is pulled from Docker Hub and launched within your Kubernetes cluster, making it available for use.
