Steps Required to Provision a 3 Node Kubernetes Cluster (1 MasterNode , 2 Worker Nodes) Using Kubespray Playbook:
0:
make sure you have ( SSHkey-Access) to all cluster nodes from your Ansible control node.
Then :

Clone the Latest KubeSpray's Github Repo, Checkout to a Specific Version ( Based On your need, Near Latest, the better!), Then install the requirements :

1:
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git

2:
cd kubespray
# It's good practice to checkout a stable release, e.g., v2.24.0. Check the latest stable release on GitHub.

3:
git checkout release-2.24

4:
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
##########requirements.txt Contents are as follows:
ansible==8.5.0
cryptography==41.0.4
jinja2==3.1.2
jmespath==1.0.1
MarkupSafe==2.1.3
netaddr==0.9.0
pbr==5.11.1
ruamel.yaml==0.17.35
ruamel.yaml.clib==0.2.8

###############
5: Define hosts file based on the reqiured pattern , offered by Kubespray sample file:

[ cp -rfp ./inventory/sample inventory/mycluster ]


hosts.yaml:


all:
  hosts:
    k8s-master-1:
      ansible_host: 10.10.10.101  # replace with your actual ip address / ssh port 
      ansible_port: 22
    k8s-worker-1:
      ansible_host: 10.10.10.102 # replace with your actual ip address / ssh port
      ansible_port: 22
    k8s-worker-2:
      ansible_host: 10.10.10.103 # replace with your actual ip address / ssh port
      ansible_port: 22
  children:
    kube_control_plane:
      hosts:
        k8s-master-1:
    kube_node:
      hosts:
        k8s-worker-1:
        k8s-worker-2:
    etcd:
      hosts:
        k8s-master-1:
    k8s_cluster:
      children:
        kube_control_plane:
        kube_node:
    
      
      
##########################Edit K8s-cluster.yaml as follows:
6: Define cilium as the prefered CNI in  k8s-cluster group_vars as follows:

inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml
      
kube_network_plugin: cilium
cilium_kube_proxy_replacement: strict # or partial, strict is recommended for full Cilium benefits
ansible_user: ubuntu # Replace 'your_username' with the actual username you use to SSH into the servers


#############Command to Run Kubespray to Provison the cluster :
7: Finaly, run the bellow command to run the kubespray's cluster provisioning process:
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml --become -u ubuntu -K cluster.yml

8: After finishing the play, run kubectl get node ( as an example ) as well as kubectl get po -n kubesystem to make sure cluster node roles are as expected, as well as system pods are up and running.
